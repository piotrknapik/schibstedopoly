# $CHIBSTâ‚¬DOPOLY

Tool for the employees so they could tame any re-org. Playing $chibstedopoly could end up having Aftenposten as a Rocket site and so on. Tested as playable Monopoly-clone ;)
Based on: https://hobbylark.com/board-games/make-your-own-monopoly and original game as well ofc.

The game was created as a Hackday project in Schibsted Tech Polska by the team: Agnieszka, Piotyr, Greg & Mateusz. BTW - $chibstedopoly won.

Version 0.8 (playable, tested!)

## Missing...

Chance, Community Chest fields on the board.

## Glossary: adjustments etc.

* The fields on the board are Sites (Schibsted sites, like VG or Leboncoin) 
* Start field is now RE-ORG
* The houses and hotels are replaced by Features and Ultimate Features
* All the rules regarding houses (now: features) and so on are in power no matter of the changed position of the particular Site (please see the ReOrg feature)
* Dollar sign '$' no longer mean 'dollar' but '$chibstedopoly NOK' (NOK in short)

## Killer feature: the ReOrg!

Each time player stands or pass on the RE-ORG field he/she collect $200 and additionally draws a Re-Org card. If the card describes the action - the action takes place when the player stands/passes the RE-ORG field.

That is why the actual fields are printed separately and placed on the board according to the 'Mapped fields' instructions (see below).

## Rules

Other printables (like the board, movable fields, property cards and money) are in the print/ folder.
Board was printed as two separate A3 sheets for our gaming - it was OK in that size.
